Be sure to include a concise explanation of key information for participants at the beginning of your consent or assent form, as shown in the examples on the website. The same elements that are required in a consent form must be adequately covered in an assent form.\nAssent forms must be understandable to children who are 7-17 years of age. The reading level must be age appropriate, and a shortened form may be needed for younger children or those with more limited reading ability. Different versions of the assent form may be needed if the study involves children of significantly different ages. A question-and-answer format, as shown in the CPHS example of an assent form, may be especially appropriate.'
